# vim-hints-and-tips

I create this repo just to record all of all hints and tips to use Vim editor. You're all welcome to contribute by jotting down all of your note, hints and tips to share with the other peoples. Just make it really short and concise like writting into a cheat sheet so we can remember it better.

Great thanks
